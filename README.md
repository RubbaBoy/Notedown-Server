# Notedown Server

This repo is the server-side code for the markdown note taking app [Notedown](https://github.com/RubbaBoy/Notedown). The code is deployed to Firebase Functions and called by the app, which allows for easier and faster authentication/data modification with better reliability compared to a separate server I would need to host myself.
